    "\n",
    "- **Simple Regression:** Involves one independent variable to estimate a dependent variable, e.g., predicting CO2 emission using engine size.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multiple Regression:** Utilizes more than one independent variable, e.g., predicting CO2 emission based on both engine size and the number of cylinders.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection:** Gather historical data with labeled CO2 emissions for various cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Model Building:** Employ regression to create an estimation model based on the collected data.\n",

    "3. **Prediction:** Apply the trained model to predict CO2 emissions for new, unseen cars.\n",

    "### **Applications of Regression:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sales Forecasting:** Predict sales using variables like age, education, and experience of a salesperson.\n",

    "- **Psychology Studies:** Determine individual satisfaction based on demographic and psychological factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real Estate:** Predict house prices by considering factors like size and number of bedrooms.\n",

    "### **Types of Regression Models:**\n",

    "- **Linear vs. Non-linear:**\n",
    "  - **Linear Regression:** Assumes a straight-line relationship between variables.\n",
